# Reflex-Trainer

A mini 3 weeks project to make a game using Verilog and VHDL programming language.
The game took inspiration from Aimlab, which is a target shooting game. In this game you will be attempting to click on as many targets that appear on screen as possible.
This game aims to be a time-killer game for when you have nothing to do, while improving your eye-hand coordination (reflexes). 
The mechanism is simple and each round is very short (30 seconds).

Enjoy~
